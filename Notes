//Calibration: use zhang's method...opencv camera calibrate with pictures of 4 calibration points.
//This generates intrinsic matrix

Use teensy 3.2 with 'send now' mode.
Also measure total round-trip time.
Calibrate time-warp mode by calibrating time to send+recieve messages to/from teensy (/2) plus calibrated time to enable LED to recieving information.
Possibly do intrinsic (and extrinsic?) untransform in 'hardware' (by writing intrinsic to uuprom.  Does teensy have floating-point hardware? No but might be fast enough)

Add to wiimote camera with clock circuit.  Also a wii lib in the firmware
